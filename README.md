In order to be considered for the AngularJs/Phonegap position, you must complete the following steps.

*Note: This task should take no longer than 1-2 hours at the most.*


## Task

1. Fork this repository (if you don't know how to do that, Google is your friend)
2. Create a *build* folder to contain your code.
3. In the *build* directory, scaffold a basic Angular app using [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/) or similar. Then create a module that does the following:
	- Connect to the [Github API](http://developer.github.com/)
	- Find the [nodejs/node](https://github.com/nodejs/node) repository
	- Find the most recent commits (choose at least 25 or more of the commits)
4. Create a view that uses the above module to display the recent commits by author.
	- If the commit hash ends in a number, color that row to light blue (#E6F1F6).
	- Add a search input at the top that filters the results
5. Package the above using cordova for Android to produce a debug APK
5. Commit and Push your code as well as the APK file to your new repository

## Once Complete
1. Commit and Push your code to your new repository
2. Send us a pull request, we will review your code and get back to you
